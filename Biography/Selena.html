                                    <p>

                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Loss of Parents:</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        One of the significant early struggles in Shah Rukh Khan's life was the loss of his parents. His father passed away when Khan was just 15 years old, and later, he lost his mother while he was pursuing his acting career. These personal losses deeply impacted him.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Financial Struggles:</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Coming from a middle-class family, Khan faced financial challenges during his initial years in the film industry. He moved to Mumbai with little money and initially lived in small rented apartments.

                                    <h3>Transition to Mumbai:</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Shah Rukh Khan moved to Mumbai with dreams of becoming an actor. His early days in the city were marked by the challenges of finding opportunities, auditions, and trying to make a mark in the competitive world of Bollywood.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Television Career:</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Before making a mark in films, Khan started his career in the entertainment industry with television. While successful, television actors were not always readily accepted in Bollywood during that era, and making the transition was a challenge.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Initial Rejections:</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Like many aspiring actors, Shah Rukh Khan faced initial rejections from film producers and casting directors. His unconventional looks and the struggle to find roles that suited his talent were initial hurdles.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Debut Film "Deewana":</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Khan's debut film "Deewana" happened after several setbacks and struggles. He had to prove himself in auditions and faced competition from established actors. The film's success marked a turning point in his career.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Film Industry Dynamics:</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Understanding and navigating the dynamics of the film industry, especially for an outsider, posed its own set of challenges. Khan had to build relationships, network, and prove his capabilities to gain acceptance.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Risk of Typecasting:</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Initially, Shah Rukh Khan faced the risk of being typecast as an anti-hero due to the success of films like "Baazigar" and "Darr." Breaking away from that image and establishing himself as a romantic hero required strategic choices.
