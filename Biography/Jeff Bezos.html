                                        Bezos developed the Dream Institute, a
                                        centre that promoted creative thinking
                                        in young students. After graduating
                                        (1986) summa cum laude from Princeton
                                        University with degrees in electrical
                                        engineering and computer science, he
                                        undertook a series of jobs before
                                        joining the New York investment bank
                                        D.E. Shaw & Co. in 1990. Soon named
                                        senior vice president—the firm’s
                                        youngest—Bezos was in charge of
                                        examining the investment possibilities
                                        of the Internet. Its enormous
                                        potential—Web usage was growing by more
                                        than 2,000 percent a year—sparked his
                                        entrepreneurial imagination. In 1994 he
                                        quit D.E. Shaw and moved to Seattle,
                                        Washington, to open a virtual bookstore.

                                        of employees, Bezos began developing the
                                        software for the site. Named after the
                                        South American river, Amazon sold its
                                        first book in July 1995.</p>

                                        January 12, 1964, in Albuquerque, New
                                        Mexico, as the son of Jacklyn (née Gise)
                                        and Ted Jorgensen.At the time of Jeff's
                                        birth, his mother was a 17-year-old
                                        high-school student and his father was
                                        19-years-old. Jorgensen was a Danish
                                        American unicyclist[12] born in Chicago
                                        to a family of Baptists. After
                                        completing high school despite
                                        challenging conditions, Jacklyn attended
                                        night school, bringing her baby with
                                        her. Jeff attended a Montessori school

                                        Ted Jorgensen drank and struggled
                                        financially.[16] Jacklyn left her
                                        husband to live with her parents, filing
                                        for divorce in June 1965 when Jeff was
                                        17-months-old.[17] After his parents
                                        divorced, his mother married Cuban
                                        immigrant Miguel "Mike" Bezos in April
                                        1968.[18] Shortly after the wedding,
                                        Mike adopted four-year-old Jeff, whose
                                        surname was then legally changed from
                                        Jorgensen to Bezos.[19] Gise, her
                                        husband and her son left the area and
                                        asked Jorgensen to discontinue contact,
                                        to which he agreed. <br> <br>

                                        After Mike had received his degree from
                                        the University of New Mexico, the family
                                        moved to Houston, Texas, so that he
                                        could begin working as an engineer for
                                        Exxon. Jeff attended River Oaks
                                        Elementary School in Houston from fourth

                                        grandfather was Lawrence Preston Gise, a
                                        regional director of the U.S. Atomic
                                        Energy Commission (AEC) in Albuquerque.
                                        Lawrence retired early to his family's
                                        ranch near Cotulla, Texas, where Jeff
                                        would spend many summers in his youth.
                                        Jeff would later purchase this ranch and
                                        expand it from 25,000 acres (10,117 ha)
                                        to 300,000 acres (121,406 ha). Jeff
                                        displayed scientific interests and
                                        technological proficiency and once
                                        rigged an electric alarm to keep his
                                        younger siblings out of his room. The
                                        family moved to Miami, Florida, where
                                        Jeff attended Miami Palmetto High
                                        School. While Jeff was in high school,
                                        he worked at McDonald's as a short-order
                                        line cook during the breakfast shift.

                                        Bezos attended the Student Science
                                        Training Program at the University of
                                        Florida. He was high school
                                        valedictorian, a National Merit Scholar,
                                        and a Silver Knight Award winner in
                                        1982. In his graduation speech, Bezos
                                        told the audience he dreamed of the day
                                        when mankind would colonize space. A
                                        local newspaper quoted his intention
                                        "to get all people off the earth and see it turned into a huge national park".

                                        network for international trade. Bezos
                                        was promoted to head of development and
                                        director of customer service thereafter.
                                        He transitioned into the banking
                                        industry when he became a product
                                        manager at Bankers Trust from 1988 to
                                        1990. He then joined D. E. Shaw & Co, a
                                        newly created hedge fund with a strong
                                        emphasis on mathematical modelling from
                                        1990 until 1994. Bezos became D. E.
                                        Shaw's fourth senior vice-president by
                                        age 30.

                                    <p>In spring 1994, Bezos read that web usage
                                        was growing at a rate of 2300% a year
                                        and eventually decided to establish an
                                        online bookstore.He and his then-wife,
                                        MacKenzie Scott, left their jobs at D.

                                        garage in Bellevue, Washington on July
                                        5, 1994, after writing its business plan
                                        on a cross-country drive from New York
                                        City to Seattle.[44][45] With Bezos at
                                        the helm and Scott taking an integral
                                        role in its operation—writing checks,
                                        keeping track of the books, and
                                        negotiating the company's first freight
                                        contracts—the foundation was laid for
                                        this garage-run operation to grow
                                        exponentially.Prior to settling in
                                        Seattle, Bezos had investigated setting
                                        up his company at an Indian reservation
                                        near San Francisco in order to avoid
                                        paying taxes. Bezos initially named his
                                        new company Cadabra but later changed
                                        the name to Amazon after the Amazon
                                        River in South America, in part because
                                        the name begins with the letter A, which
                                        is at the beginning of the alphabet. At
                                        the time, website listings were
                                        alphabetized, so a name starting with
                                        "A" would appear sooner when customers
                                        conducted online searches. In addition,
                                        he regarded "Amazon," the name of the
                                        world's largest river as fitting for
                                        what he hoped would become the world's
                                        largest online bookstore.He accepted an
                                        estimated $300,000 from his parents as
                                        an investment in Amazon.He warned many
                                        early investors that there was a 70%
                                        chance that Amazon would fail or go
                                        bankrupt. Although Amazon was originally
                                        an online bookstore, Bezos had always
                                        planned to expand to other products.
                                        Three years after Bezos founded Amazon,
                                        he took it public with an initial public
                                        offering (IPO). In response to critical
                                        reports from Fortune and Barron's, Bezos
                                        maintained that the growth of the
                                        Internet would overtake competition from
                                        larger book retailers such as Borders
                                        and Barnes & Noble. <br> <br> In 1998,
                                        Bezos diversified into the online sale
                                        of music and video, and by the end of
                                        the year he had expanded the company's
                                        products to include a variety of other
                                        consumer goods. Bezos used the $54
                                        million raised during the company's 1997
                                        equity offering to finance the
                                        aggressive acquisition of smaller
                                        competitors. In 2000, Bezos borrowed $2
                                        billion from banks, as its cash balances
                                        dipped to only $350 million. In 2002,
                                        Bezos led Amazon to launch Amazon Web
                                        Services, which compiled data from
                                        weather channels and website traffic. In
                                        late 2002, rapid spending from Amazon
                                        caused it financial distress when
                                        revenues stagnated. After the company
                                        nearly went bankrupt, he closed
                                        distribution centers and laid off 14% of
                                        the Amazon workforce. In 2003, Amazon
                                        rebounded from financial instability and
                                        turned a profit of $400 million.In
                                        November 2007, Bezos launched the Amazon
                                        Kindle.[57] According to a 2008 Time
                                        profile, Bezos wished to create a device
                                        that allowed a "flow state" in reading
                                        similar to the experience of video
                                        games. In 2013, Bezos secured a
                                        $600-million contract with the Central
                                        Intelligence Agency (CIA) on behalf of
                                        Amazon Web Services. In October of that
                                        year, Amazon was recognized as the
                                        largest online shopping retailer in the
                                        world. <br> <br>In May 2016, Bezos sold
                                        slightly more than one million shares of
                                        his holdings in the company for $671
                                        million, the largest sum he had ever
                                        raised from selling some of his Amazon
                                        stock. On August 4, 2016, Bezos sold
                                        another million of his shares for $756.7
                                        million. A year later, Bezos took on
                                        130,000 new employees when he ramped up
                                        hiring at company distribution centers.
                                        By January 19, 2018, his Amazon stock
                                        holdings had appreciated to slightly
                                        over $109 billion; months later he began
                                        to sell stock to raise cash for other
                                        enterprises, in particular, Blue Origin.
                                        On January 29, 2018, he was featured in
                                        Amazon's Super Bowl commercial. On
                                        February 1, 2018, Amazon reported its
                                        highest ever profit with quarterly
                                        earnings of $2 billion. Due to the
                                        growth of Alibaba in China, Bezos has
                                        often expressed interest in expanding
                                        Amazon into India. On July 27, 2017,
                                        Bezos momentarily became the world's
                                        wealthiest person over Microsoft
                                        co-founder Bill Gates when his estimated
                                        net worth increased to just over $90
                                        billion. His wealth surpassed $100
                                        billion for the first time on November
                                        24, 2017, and he was formally designated
                                        the wealthiest person in the world by
                                        Forbes on March 6, 2018, with a net
                                        worth of $112 billion. <br> <br> In
                                        March 2018, Bezos dispatched Amit
                                        Agarwal, Amazon's global senior vice
                                        president, to India with $5.5 billion to
                                        localize operations throughout the
                                        company's supply chain routes. Later in
                                        the month, U.S. President Donald Trump
                                        accused Amazon and Bezos, specifically
                                        of sales tax avoidance, misusing postal
                                        routes, and anti-competitive business
                                        practices. Amazon's share price fell by
                                        9% in response to the President's
                                        negative comments; this reduced Bezos's
                                        personal wealth by $10.7 billion. Weeks
                                        later, Bezos recouped his losses when
                                        academic reports out of Stanford
                                        University indicated that Trump could do
                                        little to regulate Amazon in any
                                        meaningful way. During July 2018, a
                                        number of members of the U.S. Congress
                                        called on Bezos to detail the
                                        applications of Amazon's face
                                        recognition software, Rekognition. <br>
                                        <br> Criticism of Amazon's business
                                        practices continued in September 2018
                                        when Senator Bernie Sanders introduced
                                        the Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out
                                        Subsidies (Stop BEZOS) Act and accused
                                        Amazon of receiving corporate welfare.
                                        This followed revelations by the
                                        non-profit group New Food Economy which
                                        found that one third of Amazon workers
                                        in Arizona, and one tenth of Amazon
                                        workers in Pennsylvania and Ohio, relied
                                        on food stamps. While preparing to
                                        introduce the bill, Sanders opined:
                                        "Instead of attempting to explore Mars or go to the moon, how about Jeff Bezos pays his workers a living wage?"
                                        He later said:
                                        "Bezos could play a profound role. If he said today, nobody who is employed at Amazon will receive less than a living wage, it would send a message to every corporation in America."
                                        Sanders's efforts elicited a response
                                        from Amazon which pointed to the 130,000
                                        jobs it created in 2017 and called the
                                        $28,446 figure for its median salary
                                        "misleading" as it included part-time
                                        workers. However, Sanders countered that
                                        the companies targeted by his proposal
                                        have placed an increased focus on
                                        part-time workers to escape benefit
                                        obligations. On October 2, 2018, Bezos
                                        announced a company-wide wage increase,
                                        which Sanders applauded. The American
                                        workers who were being paid the minimum
                                        wage had this increased to $15 per hour,
                                        a decision that was interpreted as
                                        support for the Fight for $15 movement.
                                        <br> <br> In February 2021, Bezos
                                        announced that in the third quarter of
                                        2021 he would step down from his role as
                                        CEO of Amazon to become the Executive
                                        Chairman of the Amazon Board. He was
                                        succeeded as CEO by Andy Jassy. On
                                        February 2, 2021, Bezos sent an email to
                                        all Amazon employees, telling them the
                                        transition would give him
                                        "the time and energy  need to focus on the Day 1 Fund, the Bezos Earth Fund, Blue Origin, The Washington Post, and other passions."</p>
                                    <h3>Blue Origin</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        In September 2000, Bezos founded Blue
                                        Origin, a human spaceflight startup.
                                        Bezos has long expressed an interest in
                                        space travel and the development of
                                        human life in the Solar System. His 1982
                                        high school valedictorian senior
                                        graduation speech was followed up with a
                                        Miami Herald interview in which he
                                        expressed an interest to build and
                                        develop hotels, amusement parks, and
                                        colonies for human beings who were in
                                        orbit. The 18-year-old Bezos stated that
                                        he wanted to preserve Earth from overuse
                                        through resource depletion. Rob Meyerson
                                        led Blue Origin from 2003 to 2017 and
                                        served as its first president. <br> <br>
                                        After its founding, Blue Origin
                                        maintained a low profile until 2006 when
                                        it purchased a large tract of land in
                                        West Texas for a launch and test
                                        facility. After the company gained the
                                        public's attention during the late
                                        2000s, Bezos additionally indicated his
                                        interest in reducing the cost of space
                                        travel for humans while also increasing
                                        the safety of extraterrestrial travel.In
                                        September 2011, one of the company's
                                        uncrewed prototype vehicles crashed
                                        during a short-hop test flight. Although
                                        the crash was viewed as a setback, news
                                        outlets noted how far the company went
                                        from its founding-to-date in advancing
                                        spaceflight.After the crash, Bezos has
                                        been superstitiously wearing his "lucky"
                                        Texas Cowboy boots to all rocket
                                        launches. In May 2013, Bezos met with
                                        Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin
                                        Galactic, to discuss commercial
                                        spaceflight opportunities and
                                        strategies.He has been compared to
                                        Branson and Elon Musk as all three are
                                        billionaires who prioritize spaceflight
                                        among their business interests. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        In 2015, Bezos announced that a new
                                        orbital launch vehicle was under
                                        development and would make its first
                                        flight in the late-2010s. Later in
                                        November, Blue Origin's New Shepard
                                        space vehicle successfully rocketed into
                                        space and reached its planned test
                                        altitude of 329,839 feet (100.5
                                        kilometers) before executing a vertical
                                        landing back at the launch site in West
                                        Texas. In 2016, Bezos allowed select
                                        journalists to visit, tour, and
                                        photograph his facility. He has
                                        repeatedly called for increased
                                        inter-space energy and industrial
                                        manufacturing to decrease the negative
                                        costs associated with business-related
                                        pollution. <br> <br> In December 2017,
                                        New Shepard successfully flew and landed
                                        dummy passengers, amending and pushing
                                        its human space travel start date into
                                        late 2018. To execute this program, Blue
                                        Origin built six of the vehicles to
                                        support all phases of testing and
                                        operations: no-passenger test flights,
                                        flights with test passengers, and
                                        commercial-passenger weekly operations.
                                        Since 2016, Bezos has spoken more freely
                                        about his hopes to colonize the solar
                                        system, and has been selling US$1
                                        billion in Amazon stock each year to
                                        capitalize Blue Origin in an effort to
                                        support this endeavor. In May 2018,
                                        Bezos maintained that the primary goal
                                        of Blue Origin is to preserve the
                                        natural resources of Earth by making the
                                        human species multi-planetary. He
                                        announced that New Shepard would begin
                                        transporting humans into sub-orbital
                                        space by November 2018. In July 2018, it
                                        was announced that Bezos had priced
                                        commercial spaceflight tickets from
                                        $200,000 to $300,000 per person. <br>

                                        On July 20, 2021, he launched on the
                                        NS-16 mission with his half-brother Mark
                                        Bezos, Wally Funk, and Oliver Daemen He
                                        launched nine days after Richard Branson
                                        launched onboard the Virgin Galactic
                                        Unity 22 mission. Bezos's suborbital
                                        flight lasted over 10 minutes, reaching
                                        a peak altitude of 66.5 miles (107.0
                                        km).

                                    <p>
                                        On August 5, 2013, Bezos announced his
                                        purchase of The Washington Post for $250
                                        million in cash, at the suggestion of
                                        his friend, Don Graham. To execute the
                                        sale, he established limited liability
                                        company Nash Holdings to serve as a
                                        holding company through which he would
                                        own the newspaper. The sale closed on
                                        October 1, 2013, and Nash Holdings took
                                        control. In March 2014, Bezos made his
                                        first significant change at The
                                        Washington Post and lifted the online
                                        paywall for subscribers of a number of
                                        U.S. local newspapers in Texas, Hawaii,
                                        and Minnesota. In January 2016, Bezos
                                        set out to reinvent the newspaper as a
                                        media and technology company by
                                        reconstructing its digital media, mobile
                                        platforms, and analytics software.After
                                        a surge in online readership in 2016,
                                        the paper was profitable for the first
                                        time since Bezos made the purchase in
                                        2013.

                                        investment resulted in 3.3 million

                                        billion in 2017. He also invested in

                                        to be a partnership between Amazon,
                                        JPMorgan, and Berkshire Hathaway. <br>

                                        Journalist Nellie Bowles of The New York
                                        Times has described the public persona
                                        and personality of Bezos as that of
                                        "a brilliant but mysterious and coldblooded corporate titan".
                                        During the 1990s, Bezos earned a
                                        reputation for relentlessly pushing
                                        Amazon forward, often at the expense of
                                        public charity and social
                                        welfare.Journalist Mark O'Connell
                                        criticized Bezos's relentless customer
                                        focus as "very small" in terms of impact
                                        on humanity as a whole,a sentiment
                                        technologist Tim O'Reilly agreed
                                        with.His business practices projected a
                                        public image of prudence and parsimony
                                        with his own wealth and that of Amazon.
                                        In 1999, Bezos was worth $10 billion yet
                                        drove a 1996 Honda Accord. Throughout
                                        the early 2000s, he was perceived to be
                                        geeky or nerdy. <br> <br>
                                        Bezos was seen by some as needlessly
                                        quantitative and data-driven.This
                                        perception was detailed by Alan
                                        Deutschman, who described him as
                                        "talking in lists" and
                                        " the criteria, in order of importance, for every decision he has made."
                                        Select accounts of his persona have
                                        drawn controversy and public attention.
                                        Notably, journalist Brad Stone wrote a
                                        book that described Bezos as a demanding
                                        boss as well as hyper-competitive, and
                                        opined that Bezos perhaps
                                        "bet the biggest on the Internet" than
                                        anyone else. Bezos has been
                                        characterized as a notoriously
                                        opportunistic CEO who operates with
                                        little concern for obstacles and
                                        externalities. <br> <br>
                                        During the early 2010s, Bezos solidified
                                        his reputation for aggressive business
                                        practices, and his public image began to
                                        shift. Bezos started to wear tailored
                                        clothing; he weight trained, pursued a
                                        regimented diet and began to freely
                                        spend his money.His physical
                                        transformation has been compared to the
                                        transformation of Amazon; he is often
                                        referred to as the metonym of the
                                        company.His physical appearance
                                        increased the public's perception of him
                                        as a symbolically dominant figure in
                                        business and in popular culture, wherein
                                        he has been parodied as an enterprising
                                        supervillain.Since 2017, he has been
                                        portrayed by Kyle Mooney and Steve
                                        Carell on Saturday Night Live, usually
                                        as an undercutting, domineering
                                        figure.[better source needed] In May
                                        2014, the International Trade Union
                                        Confederation named Bezos the

                                        secretary Sharan Burrow saying:
                                        "Jeff Bezos represents the inhumanity of employers who are promoting the North American corporate model",while
                                        in 2019, Harvard Business Review, which
                                        ranked Bezos the best-performing CEO for
                                        4 years in a row since 2014, did not
                                        rank him even in the top 100, citing
                                        Amazon's
                                        "relatively low ESG (environment, social, and governance) scores"
                                        that reflect
                                        "risks created by working conditions and employment policies, data security, and antitrust issues."

                                        During the late 2010s, Bezos reversed
                                        his reputation for being reluctant to
                                        spend money on non-business-related
                                        expenses.His relative lack of
                                        philanthropy compared to other
                                        billionaires has drawn a negative
                                        response from the public since 2016.
                                        Bezos has been known to publicly contest
                                        claims made in critical articles, as
                                        exemplified in 2015 when he sent a memo
                                        to employees denouncing a New York Times

                                        Bezos used what he called a
                                        "regret-minimization framework" while he
                                        worked at D. E. Shaw and again during
                                        the early years of Amazon. He described
                                        this life philosophy by stating:
                                        "When I'm 80, am I going to regret leaving Wall Street? No. Will I regret missing the beginning of the Internet? Yes."
                                        During the 1990s and early 2000s at
                                        Amazon, he was characterized as trying
                                        to quantify all aspects of running the
                                        company, often listing employees on
                                        spreadsheets and basing executive
                                        decisions on data. To push Amazon
                                        forward, Bezos developed the mantra
                                        "Get Big Fast", establishing the
                                        company's need to scale its operations
                                        to produce market dominance. He favored

                                        Bezos uses the term "work–life harmony"
                                        instead of the more standard
                                        "work–life balance" because he believes
                                        that balance implies that you can only
                                        have one and not the other. He believes
                                        that work and home life are
                                        interconnected, informing and
                                        calibrating each other. Journalist Walt
                                        Mossberg dubbed the idea that someone
                                        who cannot tolerate criticism or
                                        critique should not do anything new or
                                        interesting "The Bezos Principle". Bezos
                                        does not schedule early morning meetings
                                        and enforces a two-pizza rule—a
                                        preference that meetings are small
                                        enough for two pizzas to feed everyone
                                        in the boardroom.[163] When interviewing
                                        candidates for jobs at Amazon, he has
                                        stated he considers three inquiries: can
                                        he admire the person, can the person
                                        raise the common standard, and under
                                        what circumstances could the person
                                        become exemplary. <br> <br>
                                        In 2018, it was reported that he met
                                        with Amazon investors for just six hours
                                        a year.Instead of using presentation
                                        slides, Bezos requires high-level
                                        employees to present information with
                                        six-page narratives. Since 1998, Bezos
                                        has published an annual letter for
                                        Amazon shareholders wherein he
                                        frequently refers to five principles:
                                        focus on customers, not competitors;
                                        take risks for market leadership;
                                        facilitate staff morale; build a company
                                        culture; and empower people. Bezos
                                        maintains the email address
                                        jeff@amazon.com as an outlet for
                                        customers to reach out to him and the
                                        company. Although he does not respond to
                                        the emails, he forwards some of them
                                        with a question mark in the subject line
                                        to executives, who then attempt to
                                        address the issues. Bezos has cited Jeff
                                        Immelt of New Enterprise Associates,
                                        Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway,

                                    <p>
                                        In the early days of Amazon, the company
                                        faced numerous challenges. It started as
                                        an online bookstore and expanded into
                                        other product categories, but it took
                                        several years for Amazon to turn a
                                        profit. The dot-com crash of the early
                                        2000s also had a significant impact on
                                        many e-commerce companies, including
                                        Amazon.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Investor Skepticism</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        In the early years of Amazon, investors
                                        were often skeptical about the company's
                                        ability to be profitable. Bezos faced
                                        criticism for prioritizing long-term
                                        growth over short-term profits. However,
                                        his vision and persistence ultimately
                                        paid off as Amazon became one of the
                                        most valuable and successful companies
                                        in the world.

                                        Amazon faced and continues to face
                                        intense competition in the retail
                                        industry. Over the years, there have
                                        been criticisms of Amazon's business
                                        practices, treatment of workers, and its

                                        Jeff Bezos's personal life has also seen
                                        challenges, including a highly
                                        publicized divorce from his former wife,
                                        MacKenzie Scott, in 2019. The divorce
                                        settlement resulted in the transfer of a
                                        significant portion of his Amazon shares
                                        to Scott.

                                        the cost of space travel and enabling
                                        human colonization of space, involves

                                        especially for a company as large and
                                        influential as Amazon.

                                    <p>
                                        Amazon, under Bezos's leadership, has
                                        faced scrutiny from regulators
                                        concerning issues such as antitrust
                                        concerns, market dominance, and
                                        treatment of third-party sellers.
                                        Navigating these regulatory challenges
                                        and addressing concerns from various
                                        stakeholders requires strategic
                                        decision-making.

                                    <h3>Balancing Work and Personal Life</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Entrepreneurs often face the challenge
                                        of balancing the demands of building and
                                        running successful companies with
                                        personal and family life. Bezos has
                                        spoken about the importance of finding
                                        this balance, and the demands of leading
                                        a global technology and e-commerce giant
                                        undoubtedly come with personal
                                        sacrifices.
