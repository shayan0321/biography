                                        1971, Pretoria, South Africa) South
                                        African-born American entrepreneur who
                                        cofounded the electronic-payment firm
                                        PayPal and formed SpaceX, maker of
                                        launch vehicles and spacecraft. He was
                                        also one of the first significant
                                        investors in, as well as chief executive
                                        officer of, the electric car
                                        manufacturer Tesla. In addition, Musk
                                        acquired Twitter (later X) in 2022. <br>

                                        Musk was born to a South African father
                                        and a Canadian mother. He displayed an
                                        early talent for computers and
                                        entrepreneurship. At age 12 he created a
                                        video game and sold it to a computer
                                        magazine. In 1988, after obtaining a
                                        Canadian passport, Musk left South
                                        Africa because he was unwilling to
                                        support apartheid through compulsory
                                        military service and because he sought
                                        the greater economic opportunities
                                        available in the United States.</p>

                                        extraordinary</q><br>
                                    <q>When something is important enough, you

                                    <q>I think it's very important to have a
                                        feedback loop, where you're constantly
                                        thinking about what you've done and how
                                        you could be doing it better.</q><br>
                                    <q>Failure is an option here. If things are

                                        going to remain confined to one planet

                                    <p>Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28,
                                        1971, in Pretoria, South Africa.
                                        He is the eldest of three siblings. His
                                        brother, Kimbal, and sister, Tosca, are
                                        also known for their achievements in
                                        various fields.
                                        <br> <br>
                                        Musk developed an early interest in
                                        computing and technology during his
                                        childhood. He reportedly started
                                        programming at the age of 10.
                                        <br> <br>
                                        His parents are Maye Musk, a Canadian
                                        model and dietitian, and Errol Musk, a
                                        South African electromechanical
                                        engineer, pilot, and sailor.
                                        Musk has described his father as a
                                        source of inspiration in terms of his
                                        interest in technology and innovation.In
                                        the late 1980s, Musk moved to Canada to
                                        attend Queen's University at the age of
                                        17. Later, he transferred to the
                                        University of Pennsylvania in the United
                                        States.

                                        During his time at the University of
                                        Pennsylvania, Musk pursued
                                        entrepreneurial ventures. He and his
                                        brother Kimbal started a venture called
                                        Zip2, which provided business
                                        directories and maps for newspapers.
                                        Even in his early years, Musk displayed
                                        a vision for the future that involved
                                        advancing technology and addressing some
                                        of the world's most significant
                                        challenges, including space exploration
                                        and sustainable energy.

                                        Elon Musk's educational journey is
                                        marked by a combination of academic
                                        pursuits and a relentless drive for
                                        entrepreneurship. Born on June 28, 1971,
                                        in Pretoria, South Africa, Musk
                                        initially attended the University of
                                        Pretoria before transferring to the
                                        University of Pennsylvania in the United
                                        States. At the University of
                                        Pennsylvania, he pursued dual bachelor's
                                        degrees, earning a Bachelor of Science
                                        in Physics from the College of Arts and
                                        Sciences and a Bachelor of Science in
                                        Economics from the Wharton School of
                                        Business. Musk's educational background
                                        reflects a multidisciplinary approach,
                                        blending his scientific interests with
                                        an understanding of economic principles.

                                        While Musk embarked on a Ph.D. program
                                        at Stanford University, his
                                        entrepreneurial spirit led him to leave
                                        after just two days to explore business
                                        opportunities. His decision to focus on
                                        the emerging fields of the internet,
                                        renewable energy, and space exploration
                                        would shape his future endeavors. Musk's
                                        early ventures included the co-founding
                                        of Zip2, a web software company, and
